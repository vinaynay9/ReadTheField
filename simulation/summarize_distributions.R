# Summarize Distributions

# This file contains functions for aggregating and summarizing simulation output distributions into interpretable metrics.
# It computes summary statistics including means, medians, quantiles, and confidence intervals from simulation results.
# The module generates distributional summaries that capture both central tendencies and uncertainty ranges.
# Distribution summarization produces outputs suitable for reporting, visualization, and decision support applications.
# The functions handle aggregation across multiple simulation runs and different outcome variables of interest.
# This module transforms raw simulation outputs into actionable insights by providing concise statistical summaries of probabilistic forecasts.
