# Simulate Matchup

# This file contains functions for executing simulation scenarios for specific matchups using trained models.
# It orchestrates Monte Carlo simulations that generate probabilistic outcome distributions rather than point predictions.
# The module handles simulation setup including scenario definition, model selection, and parameter configuration.
# Matchup simulations account for uncertainty in both model predictions and potential game outcomes to produce full probability distributions.
# The simulation process generates thousands of simulated outcomes that can be aggregated into probability distributions and summary statistics.
# This module enables decision-making under uncertainty by providing comprehensive probabilistic forecasts for specific matchups.
