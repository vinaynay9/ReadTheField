# Calibration Analysis

# This file contains functions for analyzing and validating the calibration of predicted probabilities.
# It implements diagnostic tests to ensure that predicted probabilities match observed outcome frequencies across probability ranges.
# The module performs calibration curve analysis, reliability diagrams, and statistical tests for calibration quality.
# Calibration analysis identifies systematic biases where models are overconfident or underconfident in their predictions.
# The validation process generates calibration metrics and visualizations to assess and improve model reliability.
# This module ensures that probabilistic predictions can be trusted for applications requiring accurate probability estimates.
