# Interval Coverage

# This file contains functions for validating prediction interval coverage and calibration of uncertainty estimates.
# It assesses whether predicted confidence intervals contain the true outcomes at the specified confidence levels.
# The module computes coverage statistics across different prediction quantiles and identifies systematic biases in uncertainty estimation.
# Interval coverage validation helps ensure that models provide reliable uncertainty quantification for decision-making.
# The analysis generates diagnostic reports showing coverage rates, interval widths, and calibration quality metrics.
# This module is critical for validating that probabilistic predictions accurately represent prediction uncertainty.
