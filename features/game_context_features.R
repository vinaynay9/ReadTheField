# Game Context Features

# This file contains functions for extracting and engineering game situation and environmental context features.
# It processes variables such as weather conditions, venue type, rest days, and game importance indicators.
# The module captures temporal context including day of week, time of season, and proximity to playoffs.
# Game context features also include matchup-specific variables like home field advantage and rivalry indicators.
# These contextual factors help models adjust predictions based on situational circumstances beyond player and team statistics.
# The output provides standardized context feature vectors that enhance model accuracy by accounting for environmental and situational factors.
