# External Data Directory

This directory contains external reference data that supplements the primary data sources used in modeling. The player_metadata.parquet file stores static player information including player_id, name, team affiliation, position, and optional headshot URL. This metadata enables joining player identifiers with human-readable information and supports visualization and reporting workflows. External data files are typically updated less frequently than raw or processed data and serve as lookup tables for enriching model outputs with descriptive information.
