# Snapshots Directory

This directory stores historical snapshots of raw data ingested at specific points in time. Each snapshot represents a complete copy of the data as it existed when ingested, enabling temporal analysis and reproducibility of past model training runs. Snapshots are organized by timestamp or version identifier to maintain a clear audit trail of data states used in different modeling experiments. This approach supports model versioning and allows comparison of model performance across different data versions. The snapshot structure ensures that historical analyses can be reproduced exactly as they were originally executed.
