# Latest Directory

This directory contains the most recent version of raw data available for processing. It serves as the primary source for feature engineering and model training workflows. The latest directory is updated through the ingestion pipeline whenever new data becomes available. This structure separates current operational data from historical snapshots, allowing the system to always reference the most up-to-date information while preserving historical records. The latest directory acts as the staging area for data that will flow into processed data transformations.
