# Train Baseline Models

# This file contains functions for training baseline predictive models on assembled feature data.
# It implements standard modeling approaches including linear models, tree-based methods, and ensemble techniques.
# The module handles hyperparameter configuration, cross-validation setup, and model training orchestration.
# Baseline models serve as performance benchmarks and starting points for more sophisticated modeling approaches.
# Trained models are saved with metadata to the model registry for version tracking and deployment.
# This module provides the core functionality for converting feature data into predictive models ready for validation and use.
