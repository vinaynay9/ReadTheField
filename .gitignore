# Git ignore file for read-the-field analytics repository

# This file specifies patterns for files and directories that should be excluded from version control.
# It prevents committing sensitive data, temporary files, R workspace artifacts, and large binary files.
# Common patterns include R workspace files, cache directories, log files, and environment-specific configurations.
# Data files in raw and processed directories are typically excluded to keep repository size manageable.
# Model artifacts and prediction outputs may be excluded or selectively committed based on project needs.

# Cache directory (local nflverse data cache)
data/cache/
data/processed/
data/raw/
data/external/

# Simulation outputs and logs
rb_simulation_output.txt
bijan_simulation_output.txt
rb_debug.log
