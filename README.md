# ReadTheField
Read the Field is a probabilistic NFL analytics project that predicts player performance based on historical usage, opponent matchups, and game context. It produces distribution-based projections rather than single-point estimates, emphasizing uncertainty, repeatable modeling, and real-world decision making.
