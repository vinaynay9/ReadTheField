# Model Registry

# This file contains functions for managing model metadata, versioning, and storage in the model registry system.
# It handles registration of trained models with associated metadata including training dates, hyperparameters, and performance metrics.
# The module provides interfaces for retrieving specific model versions and querying the registry for model information.
# Model registry functions support model comparison, selection, and rollback capabilities for production deployments.
# The registry maintains relationships between models, training data versions, and validation results for full traceability.
# This module ensures that model artifacts are properly catalogued and accessible throughout the modeling lifecycle.
